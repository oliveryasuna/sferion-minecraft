Waste your life away in a Minecraft server with your colleagues (and pretend they are your friends)!

## Extra

### Patience

If your potato computer is struggling, be patient.
Minecraft just may take a while to load.

### Fuzzy Fix

Enable mipmapping in video settings.

### Performance

Install these mods:
- [Chloride](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chloride/files/6615986)
- [Rubidium Extra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubidium-extra/files/6101745)

If that doesn't help, try reducing your render distance.

Furthermore, you can tweak other video settings.
Mouse over a setting to see its effect on performance.

### Suggested Mods

- [Skin Layers 3D](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skin-layers-3d/files/7091094) - Client-side only
- [Enchantment Descriptions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchantment-descriptions/files/5855251)
- [Forge Config Screens](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge/files/4672356) - Client-side only

### 4K Display

I suggest changing your GUI Scale to 3x.

### JEI Configuration

To edit JEI settings in-game, you'll need to install [Configured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured/files/5180900).

### Zoom Keymap Conflict

I suggest changing "Hotbar Swapper" to `Y`, and keep the default "Zoom" key (`Z`)

### Shaders

Good luck...

### My Potato Computer Caught On Fire and Exploded My Toes Off

Sounds like a *you* problem...
